# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator-ALPHA-
In style of Pok√©mon Platinum, my favourite mainline game. Uses pure JS, CSS and html.

This was mainly just to see if I could do it on my own.

Had to learn promises, seems javascript might not be the best language for this task. 

Timing all the animations and dialgoue was definitley the biggest task.

Still an alpha version so not every feature is here. 

It's a mixture of hard coded for this specfic battle and softcoded which could be expanded for more pokemon was kinda rushed unfortunatley.

Imagine using a pokemon api for this that randomly generates 6 enemy pokemon each time...

I didnt have as much time to refine this personal project as I have an actual job to do.. :( so excuse the odd loose end and enjoy - Leo
